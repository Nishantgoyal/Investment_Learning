## What are Continuing Claims

- Continuing claims are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim
- In order to be included in continuing claims, the person must be covered by unemployment insurance and currently receiving benefits
- They must have been unemployed for at least a week after filing the initial claim, per Department of Labor specifications

## Understanding Continuing Claims

- Continuing claims data refers to unemployed people who have already filed a claim and who are continuing to receive weekly benefits
- Continued claims are not a leading indicator for the state of the unemployment market, meaning they cannot predict changes in the market
- But they are considered a good snapshot of the market because they provide evidence of the continuing direction of the economy.
- Critics point to the volatility of the data which makes it somewhat imprecise as a snapshot of employment conditions
- When combined with other indicators onto a four-week moving average, it provides a clearer indication
- However, this interpretation is not completely accurate since continuing claims figures excludes several groups, including workers not eligible for unemployment insurance and workers who have exhausted their benefits.
