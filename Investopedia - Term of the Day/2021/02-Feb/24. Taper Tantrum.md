## What Is the Taper Tantrum?

- The phrase, `taper tantrum`, describes the 2013 surge in U.S. Treasury yields
- It was a result from the Federal Reserve's (Fed) announcement of future tapering of its policy of quantitative easing
- The Fed announced that it would be reducing the pace of its purchases of Treasury bonds, to reduce the amount of money it was feeding into the economy
- The ensuing rise in bond yields in reaction to the announcement was referred to as a taper tantrum in financial media

## Understanding Taper Tantrum

- In reaction to the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing recession, the Federal Reserve executed a policy known as `quantitative easing (QE)`
- It involves large purchases of bonds and other securities
- In theory, this increases liquidity in the financial sector to maintain stability and promote economic growth
- Stabilizing the financial sector encouraged lending, to allow consumers to spend and businesses to invest
- quantitative easing is a monetary policy designed to infuse more dollars into the circulation of the economy
- quantitative easing has been considered only usable as a short-term fix
  - because of the danger that could arise from falling dollar values
  - leading to hyperinflation
- Traditional economists would insist that
  - when the Federal Reserve feeds the economy for too long
  - there are unavoidable consequences
- Tapering gradually reduces the amount of money the Fed pumps into the economy
  - It should theoretically incrementally reduce the economy's reliance on that money
  - and allow the Fed to remove itself as the economy's crutch.
- However, since 2015, the Fed has found a variety of ways to infuse cash into the economy without lowering the value of the dollar
- However, investor behavior always involves not just current conditions, but expectations of future economic performance and Fed policy
- If the public gets word that the Fed is planning to engage in tapering, panic can still ensue, because people worry that the lack of money will trigger market instability
- This is particularly a problem the more dependent the market has become on continued Fed support.
