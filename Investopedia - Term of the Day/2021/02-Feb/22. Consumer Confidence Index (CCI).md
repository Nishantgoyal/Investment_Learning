## What Is the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)?

- It is a monthly survey of 5000 U.S. Households, administered by `The Conference Board`
- It measures how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are regarding their expected financial situation
- It is based on the premise that
  - if consumers are optimistic, they will spend more and stimulate the economy
  - but if they are pessimistic then their spending patterns could lead to a recession
- Consumer spending accounts for a huge percentage of GDP, and hence Consumer Confidence is an important indicator of where the economy might be headed
- Economists consider CCI as a lagging indicator, meaning it changes after not before the economy changes
